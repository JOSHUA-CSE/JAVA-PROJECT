# JAVA-PROJECT
# TIMETABLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
  The Timetable Management System is a simple Java project that allows schools/colleges to maintain and retrieve timetables for teachers and sections while ensuring no conflicts occur (e.g., the same teacher cannot handle two classes at the same time).It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.


# Features

  ->Add schedules for different sections.
  
  ->Assign teachers to subjects and sections.
  
  ->Retrieve timetable of a specific section.
  
  ->Retrieve timetable of a specific teacher.
  
  ->Conflict detection (prevents a teacher from being scheduled in two classes at the same time).
  
  ->Easy to extend with new sections or teachers.
# Objectives

  ->To design a simple timetable manager using UML diagrams and implement it in Java.
  
  ->To apply OOP concepts in a practical project.
  
  ->To provide features for teachers and students to easily access their timetables.
  
  ->To ensure conflict-free scheduling (a teacher cannot be assigned to two sections at the same time).

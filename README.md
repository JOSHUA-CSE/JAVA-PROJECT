# JAVA-PROJECT
# TIMETABLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
  The Timetable Management System is a simple Java project that allows schools/colleges to maintain and retrieve timetables for teachers and sections while ensuring no conflicts occur (e.g., the same teacher cannot handle two classes at the same time).It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.


# Features

  ->Add schedules for different sections.
  
  ->Assign teachers to subjects and sections.
  
  ->Retrieve timetable of a specific section.
  
  ->Retrieve timetable of a specific teacher.
  
  ->Conflict detection (prevents a teacher from being scheduled in two classes at the same time).
  
  ->Easy to extend with new sections or teachers.
# OOP Concepts Used
  
  ->Inheritance: Sections inherit common schedule features.
  
  ->Polymorphism: Different sections/teachers can display timetables in their own way.
  
  ->Association: ClassSchedule is associated with both Teacher and Section.
